### Hi there, I'm Alexandre Madeira ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer from Brazil with a passion for building native, easy-to-use software. I specialize in Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit (programmatically) at the moment and have experience with C#, UWP, HTML, CSS, and basic experience with JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

## My Experience
- I've built some apps over the years, including Cronica, which is available on the [App Store](https://apple.co/3TV9SLP ) for all Apple platforms (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS) and open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/MadeiraAlexandre/Cronica).
- I used to develop apps for Windows using UWP, one of my apps, Celestial, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MadeiraAlexandre/Celestial) as well.
- My interests right now are mainly focused on Apple systems and backend development. I'm currently learning Rust and I'm always looking to learn more and improve my skills to deliver better software.
